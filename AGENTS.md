# AGENTS.md - AI Assistant Guide

Rules are canonical in `.github/instructions/` and shared across Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

## Rules - General

- IMPORTANT: NEVER include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages. Not ever, not for any reason.

## Rules - Markdown Tables

- Padded pipes: one space on each side of every `|`, including the separator row.
- Align column widths so all cells in the same column are equal width.

## Rule Files

> Note: the full `.github/instructions/` rule set from the monorepo has not been copied here yet.
> Until it is, follow general TypeScript, ESLint, and naming conventions from prior context.

## Project-Specific

Project-specific rules live in `.github/instructions/project/`. Add `*.instructions.md` files there and link them here.

<!-- NOTE: CLI projects (genx:type:cli keyword in package.json) only -->

- Generated README sections are managed by `pnpm docs.usage` — never edit content between `<!-- GENERATED:*:START/END -->` markers by hand.

- This is a **standalone installable package** (`@finografic/design-system`), not a monorepo workspace.
- Published to GitHub Packages (`https://npm.pkg.github.com`).
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.
- Do not reference `@workspace/*` — all imports and deps must use published package names.
- The `panda.preset` entry must always build with `platform: 'node'` in tsdown.
- Never add `watch: true` to `panda.config.ts` — it causes `panda codegen` to hang.

## Learned User Preferences

- Follow existing recipe patterns for naming, structure, and variant conventions
- Apply recipes inside design-system components; client uses `<Button variant="..." />` without calling the recipe
- Use cva for single-element components (e.g. Button); use sva for multi-slot components (Checkbox, Card, Dialog)
- Use @stylistic/stylelint-plugin for Stylelint 17; stylelint-stylistic is deprecated and incompatible
- Ignore .cursor/chats and .cursor/hooks; commit .cursor/mcp.json
- Use Panda MCP for design-system questions (breakpoints, tokens, recipes) when relevant without explicit user ask
